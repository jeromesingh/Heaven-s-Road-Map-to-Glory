  <p class="text">Jesus was inaugurated into his high priestly ministry.

  </p>

  <p class="bible">Hebrews 7:12-14 KJV  For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.  (13)  For
  he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.  (14)  For
  it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

</p>

  <p class="bible" >Hebrews 8:4 KJV  For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts
  according to the law:

</p>

<p class="text">The Passover, Feast of unleaven bread and First Fruits was all connected to the court yard.

</p>

<p class="text">Pentecost was to be acknowledged 50 days after the unleavened bread starting from the first fruits which happened on the
16 day and this was the holy place.


  </p>

<p class="bible" >Leviticus 23:23-25 KJV  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  (24)  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the
seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy
convocation.  (25)  Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

</p>
<br>
<h5>Principles of the blowing of the trumpets</h5>

<p class="bible">Numbers 10:1-2 KJV  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  (2)  Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece
shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.

</p>

<p class="bible">Numbers 10:8-10 KJV  And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an
ordinance for ever throughout your generations.  (9)  And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth
you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be
saved from your enemies.  (10)  Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your
months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that
they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.

</p>

<p class="bible">Numbers 28:11-15 KJV  And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young
bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;  (12)  And three tenth deals of flour for a meat
offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one
ram;  (13)  And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering
of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.  (14)  And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine
unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt
offering of every month throughout the months of the year.  (15)  And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the
LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

</p>

<p class="bible">Numbers 29:1-6 KJV  And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall
do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.  (2)  And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet
savour unto the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without blemish:  (3)  And their
meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram,  (4) 
And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:  (5)  And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make
an atonement for you:  (6)  Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and the daily burnt offering,
and his meat offering, and their drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by
fire unto the LORD.

</p>
<br>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 23:27 KJV  Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy
convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 9:7 KJV  And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and
make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them;
as the LORD commanded.

</p>

<p class="bible">Proverbs 28:13 KJV  He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have
mercy.

</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 16:2 KJV  And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the
holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud
upon the mercy seat.

</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 16:16 KJV  And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of
Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the
congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

</p>

<p class="bible">Titus 2:11-13 KJV  For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,  (12)  Teaching us that,
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;  (13) 
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

</p>

<p class="text">We can endure temptation
</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 16:16 KJV  And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of
Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the
congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

</p>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 16:19 KJV  And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow
it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.

</p>


<p class="bible">Hebrews 10:9-17 KJV  Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the
second.  (10)  By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.  (11) 
And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
 (12)  But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;  (13) 
From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.  (14)  For by one offering he hath perfected for ever
them that are sanctified.  (15)  Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
 (16)  This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their
hearts, and in their minds will I write them;  (17)  And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

</p>

<p class="text">God wants to sanctify us.</p>

<p class="bible">1 Thessalonians 5:23 KJV  And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and
body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

</p>


<p class="text">God is willing to blot out our sins if we commit to him.
